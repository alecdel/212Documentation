# Welcome to my group's final project 

We used Comb sort, Treap, and Kruskal's algorithm to create a project that can be used as a warehouse delivery network or in other scenarios.
It contains the main file: project.cpp, and the graph_data.txt file.

Anyone is free to use the program, as it is a simple demonstration.

If you plan to change the code, you can easily implement changes by simply modifying the code. or applying different algorithms.
